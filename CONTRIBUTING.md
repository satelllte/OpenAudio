# Contributing

Our site and README are generate from lists defined in code. **Links are no longer edited directly in the README.** To contribute links you will need to modify **[data.json](./generator/src/data/data.json)** file and submit a new GitHub Pull Request (PR). You can do that directly on GitHub by clicking the `Edit` button on the top right of the page when viewing any of the collection files:

_Do not edit any other files as updating a generated file will cause your changes to be lost._
